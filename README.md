# User-Directory

The user directory application is my first attempt at React. There isn't a database, just the front end.
A table was created using the Bootstrap table. For some reason I was unable to get the columns to sort, but will attempt to do so at a later time.
I will use the React table creator to see if it's more straightfoward.

Search isn't functioning properly either, but I will revisit it as well.
